* Load a web page from cache when device is online. Cache is loaded from the Documents folder or from the application bundle if cache wasn't created yet (if page wasn't load when device online even once).
* Support of pre-cache for web pages, to make them accessible even if they were not loaded once. To make this happen, read instructions bellow.

## Requirements

* iOS 8.0+
* ARC
* XCode 6+

 * Open web pages which are required to pre-cache in the app to create cache of them under the Documents folder
 * Access the application Documents folder to copy 'WebCache' directory, for device and simulator approaches are different
    * On device set 'UIFileSharingEnabled' key to YES in the Info.plist, and access Documents from the iTunes
    * On Simulator the one can navigate to the Documents folder via Finder. Use next folder as start point:     ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/
